# sorting-algorithms-test
Kind of "benchmark" I wanted to do on my own, to practice, test and gather many sorting algorithms in one place.

Things I want to acomplish with this project:
- use scanf() and printf() instead of cin and cout (it works faster)
- comment the code well in English
- use at least 5 sorting algorithms:
  - bubble sort
  - quick sort
  - merge sort
  - selection sort
  -
- finish the project before 21st of February
